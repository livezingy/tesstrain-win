Train Tesseract LSTM with make on Windows
# About tesstrain-win
The tesstrain-win comes from the  [tesseract-ocr/tesstrain](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesstrain) , In order to make it run on Windows, there are some changes to the makefile and the overall file structure.

The ocrd-train(OCR-D/ocrd-train) in tesstrain-win is the Predecessor of [tesseract-ocr/tesstrain](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesstrain). it Could help us understand the makefile of tesseract-ocr/tesstrain.

The file structure in tesstrain-win:

# Requirements
## tesseract
You will need a recent version (>= 4.0.0beta1) of tesseract built with the training tools and matching leptonica bindings. 

Build instructions and more can be found in the [Tesseract project wiki](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).

Build tesseract instructions on Windows can be found in the [Tesseract4.0+VS2017+win10](https://livezingy.com/compilation-tesseract4-in-vs2017-win10/).
## Python
You need a recent version of Python 3.x. For image processing the Python library Pillow is used.
## Cygwin
In order to run the makefile on Windows, you need the Cygwin. Install instructions could refer to [Install Cygwin on Win10 for makefile](https://livezingy.com/install-cygwin-on-win10-for-makefile/)
# How to Use tesstrain-win
Before training your own database, it is recommended to train [ocrd-testset.zip](https://github.com/livezingy/tesstrain-win/tree/master/data/foo-ground-truth) first.

If the [ocrd-testset.zip](https://github.com/livezingy/tesstrain-win/tree/master/data/foo-ground-truth) can be trained normally, it means that the current computer training environment is OK.
## How to train ocrd-testset.zip
1. Extract ./data/foo-ground-truth/ocrd-testset.zip to ./data/foo-ground-truth.

2. Run the command prompt as an administrator, Go to the tesstrain-win directory, e. g.:

```
cd %USERPROFILE%/tesstrain-win
```

3. run make training
```
make training
```

## How to train your own database
1. Give your database a name

   You could give the name by change the line 11 in **makefile**
```
MODEL_NAME = New_Name
```
   Or you could give the name when you run **make training**
```
make training MODEL_NAME=New_Name
```
2. Prepare the base traineddata

   If you train from scratch, no need to do this. If you train Fine-tune, download the base traineddata from the [tessdata_best](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best),and Place it to the ./data/tessdata.

3. update the foo.numbers/foo.punc/foo.wordlist in data filefolder

   If you choose TRAIN FROM SCRATCH(no value for the START_MODEL in makefile), no need to change them; If you choose Fine-tune(Set value for START_MODEL in makefile),The three files should be consistent with the base traineddata. Ex, if your base traineddata is eng, You could download them from [langdata_lstm/eng](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/langdata_lstm/tree/master/eng).But you need to rename them separatelyï¼šNew_Name.numbers/New_Name.punc/New_Name.wordlist after download.

4. Prepare the ground truth

   Place ground truth consisting of line images and transcriptions in the folder data/MODEL_NAME-ground-truth. This list of files will be split into training and evaluation data, the ratio is defined by the RATIO_TRAIN variable.

   Images must be TIFF and have the extension .tif or PNG and have the extension .png, .bin.png or .nrm.png.

   Transcriptions must be single-line plain text and have the same name as the line image but with the image extension replaced by .gt.txt.

5. Run the command prompt as an administrator, Go to the tesstrain-win directory, e. g.:
```
cd %USERPROFILE%/tesstrain-win
```

6. run make training
```
make training
```
